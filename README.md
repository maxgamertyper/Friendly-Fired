# Friendly-Fired
removes the possibility of your own ability killing you

A mod that makes it so that used abilities cant harm its owner (the person who used the ability). (missile, mine, smoke, grenade, tesla coil, spike, arrow, black hole). The Black hole no longer kills you or pulls you towards it
